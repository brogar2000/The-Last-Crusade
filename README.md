# The Last Crusade
 The Last Crusade is a game made by Patrick Dwyer & Peter S. VanLund. The game was made as an example of what the game engine and map maker they created could do. Unfortunately, the map maker wasn't used very much because it was not accessible to screen readers, so beyond the game itself the engine and map maker never gained much traction. This may have also been due to the lack of documentation on the engine, and as such I unfortunately cannot tell you what dependencies are required to work with the source code or even what licence the code is under. Feel free to update this repo if you guys know anything I don't. I will, however, provide the descriptions they gave on their website in the hopes that it might help the more code savvy part of the community figure out how to make changes. Pull requests are very much welcome. When making a pull request, please provide a build version containing the same changes you made in the source. Enjoy.
